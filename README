Mcucpp - is a C++ hardware abstraction library for microcontrollers.

The aim of the project is to make a high level but extremly efficient C++ hardware abstraction framework for different microcontroller families.

Prerequisites:
1. Python 2.7.x;
2. SCons build tool;
3. GNU toolchain for target paltform and for host system for unit tests. Currently supported targets:
	- AVR;
	- ARM;
	- MSP430;
	
All prerequisite tools need to be available on environment PATH variable.
